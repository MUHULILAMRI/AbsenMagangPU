Need to install the following packages:
@next/codemod@16.0.5
Ok to proceed? (y) y

npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.
npm warn deprecated rimraf@2.6.3: Rimraf versions prior to v4 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated glob@7.2.3: Glob versions prior to v9 are no longer supported
npm warn deprecated cross-spawn-async@2.2.5: cross-spawn no longer requires a build toolchain, use it instead
Thank you for using @next/codemod!

But before we continue, please stash or commit your git changes.

You may use the --force flag to override this safety check.
